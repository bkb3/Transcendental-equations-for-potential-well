\[Gamma] = k Cot[k];
Plot[\[Gamma], {k, 0, 10}]

(*Now to solve for the roots we will try the inbuilt function Solve
at first*)
(*We assume \[Gamma] = 0.01*)
Solve[0.01 == k Cot[k], k]

(*See that this cannot be solved. It is because it has infinitely
many solutions for k. Just see the graph above and notice that the
curve intesects X axis 3 times within interval 0 to 10. Which means
along x axis the graph cuts many many times*)
(*So we limit the range of k so search the solutions within that
range*)
(*I will limit k from 0 to 15 as follows*)
Quiet@Solve[{0.01 == k Cot[k], 0 < k < 15}, k]

(*The output is {{k -> 1.5644}, {k -> 4.71027}, {k -> 7.85271}, {k -> 10.9947}, {k -> 
   14.1365}}*)


(*Similarly put \[Gamma] =1 and solve*)
Solve[{1 == k Cot[k], 0 < k < 15}, k] // FullSimplify

(*Now we solve for \[Gamma] = Infinity*)
Solve[{Infinity == k Cot[k], 0 < k < 15}, k] // FullSimplify

(*It threw an error due to infinity.*)
(*So we invert the equation and solve*)
(*There are many ways to solve such infinite equations but this
approach of inverting is probably easiest for you*)
(*N means we want result in numeric from otherwise you get values in
Pi)*)
N[Solve[{0 == k Tan[k], 0 < k < 15}, k] // FullSimplify]

(*The output is {{k -> 3.14159}, {k -> 6.28319}, {k -> 9.42478}, {k -> 12.5664}}*)

(*-----------------The above is for real valued k----------------------------*)
(*-----------------For complex k we seperate real and complex part and equate them separately as follows-----------*)

Quiet[NSolve[{0.01 == k Cot[k], 0 < k < 15}, k]]

(*Those were the values for k*)
(*Our \[Gamma] = 0.01 + 0.001I for the first case*)
(*So we equate the imagnary part found above by ComplexExpand[Im[]]
to 0.001 and solve for various values of k*)
(*Click in the number in the output box to get the value*)
Manipulate[
 Solve[{ComplexExpand[Im[(k + I j) Cot[k + I j]]] == 0.001, -1 < j < 
    1}, j], {k, {1.56, 4.71, 7.58}}]
    

(*Similarly for second case \[Gamma] = 1+ 0.1I*)
(*As above we solve for real part first like above*)
(*and use k to solve for imaginary part. Also note that the imaginary 
part = 0.1 in this case*)
(*Click the numbers in output box to see the output for various k*)


Manipulate[
 Solve[{ComplexExpand[Im[(k + I j) Cot[k + I j]]] == 0.01, -1 < j < 
    1}, j], {k, {0.391, 4.49, 7.73, 10.90}}]
    
    
(*Similarly for next*)
(*Rather than doing separately, I will no combine evrything we have
done so far in a single formula. Click on corresponding k and
\[Gamma] to get required values*)

(*Here is how to get the values interactively*)
(*First click the drop down menu for  values of \[Gamma]*)
(*Then use slider for various values of k as you please, which will
be shown in the output*)
(*For example initially, k= 1.56 and \[Gamma] = 0.01*)

Manipulate[{k, 
  Solve[{ComplexExpand[Im[(k + I j) Cot[k + I j]]] == \[Gamma], -1 < 
     j < 1}, j]}, {{k, 1.56}, 0, 
  10}, {{\[Gamma], 0.01}, {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100}}]
  
(*Might give some errors but who cares!*)
